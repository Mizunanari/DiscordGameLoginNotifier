MCRcon
======

This library provides a straightforward implementation of Minecraft's
`Rcon protocol`_ in Python to provide a client for handling Remote Commands
(RCON) to a Minecraft server.

.. _Rcon protocol: http://wiki.vg/Rcon

Installation
############

The library is availble on PYPI and can be installed with pip::

    pip install mcrcon

Usage
#####

The recommend way to run this client is using the python 'with' statement.
This ensures that the socket is correctly closed when you are done with it
rather than being left open.

Example::

    In [1]: from mcrcon import MCRcon
    In [2]: with MCRcon("10.1.1.1", "sekret") as mcr:
       ...:     resp = mcr.command("/whitelist add bob")
       ...:     print(resp)

While you can use it without the 'with' statement, you have to connect
manually, and ideally disconnect::

    In [3]: mcr = MCRcon("10.1.1.1", "sekret")
    In [4]: mcr.connect()
    In [5]: resp = mcr.command("/whitelist add bob")
    In [6]: print(resp)
    In [7]: mcr.disconnect()

Command Line Usage
##################

After installing the package a cli will be included that can be used.

Help can be gotten by doing::

    mcrcon --help

You can connect from the console with commands like the following::

    mcrcon 10.1.1.1

You will either be prompted for your password, or you can set it as follows
as an environment variable::

    export RCON_PASSWORD=sekret

And then you can run commands on the server interactively::

    > /whitelist add bob
